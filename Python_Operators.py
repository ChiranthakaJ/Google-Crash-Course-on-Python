print("Yellow" > "Brown" and "Magenta" > "Cyan") 

#Result ==> True
#Reason is Y comes after B and M comes after C.

#The operators checked the strings against the alphabetical order of the English language.

print(25 >50 or 1 != 2)

#Result ==> True
#Reason is either one of the logics are correct. In here 1 is not equal to 2 and is correct. But 25 is not larger than 50 and it's false. Since one of the two logics and correct the result is 'True'.

#The answer to be 'True' either if the logics or all the logics should be true. If none of them were true the answer is false.


#The not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.
